### Reversed Text
Sometimes a ***ciphertext*** is just as easy as reversed text. Don't forgot to check under this rock!<br><br>
You can reverse a string using a simple Bash script:
```bash
echo string | rev
```
Or using Python:
```python
ct = "string"
print(ct[::-1])
```

### Atbash Cipher
The Atbash cipher is a substitution cipher with a specific key where the letters of the alphabet are reversed i.e. all A's are replaced with Z's, all B's are replaced with Y's, and so on. It was originally used for the Hebrew alphabet, but can be used for any alphabet system.<br><br>
You can use the following tools to encrypt/decrypt using the Atbash cipher:
